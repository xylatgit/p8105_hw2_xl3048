## Problem 1

Define the path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read in the dataset Mr.Trashwheel.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset: \* The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster
in 2017 was 8 \* The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Define the path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data_2 = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

Read in the dataset.

``` r
subway_df =
  read_csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
    )%>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(select = c(line:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada))%>%
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry=="YES",1,2),
    vending =  ifelse(vending=="YES",1,2),
    line = stringr::str_replace_all(line,fixed(" "),""),
    station_name = stringr::str_replace_all(station_name,fixed(" "),""),
    route8=as.character(route8),
    route9=as.character(route9),
    route10=as.character(route10),
    route11=as.character(route11)
  )
```

The original dataset on NYC Transit has 32 variables. For the homework,
we select 19 variables: line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada. The selected variables contains information about
subway stations in NYC, including their location, route served, entrance
type (stairs/easement), whether it is vending allowing in the station,
and whether it is ADA compliant.

The variable names of the resulted dataset is cleaned using janitor (all
lower-cased, replace space by dash). Variables of route served contains
numerous spaces, which are not recognized as NA by R when the dataset is
read. Thus, parameter na.string is purposely added to the read.csv
function. Character vector “entry” and “vending” are converted to
logical vector (1=YES, 2=NO).Unlike route1 to route7, which use
characters to represent route number, the route number for route8 to
route11 are numeric. Thus, they are converted to character as the
dataset is read.The spaces within line and station names are deleted for
potential future usage.

The dimension of the resulted dataset is 1868 rows by 19 columns.

``` r
unique_station <- subway_df%>%
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

There are 465 distinct stations in the dataset.

``` r
ada_compliant<- unique_station%>%
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

There are 84 distinct stations with ADA compliance.

``` r
novending_entrance <- subway_df%>%
  filter(vending == "2",entry == "1")
novending_ent_exit <- subway_df %>%
  filter(vending == "2")
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 0.3770492.

``` r
route_transit_df =
  pivot_longer(
    unique_station,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number"
 ) 
unique_A <- route_transit_df %>%
  filter(route_number == "A")

unique_A_ADA <- unique_A %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

60 unique stations serve the A train. Of the station that serves the A
train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Define the path to the dataset.
