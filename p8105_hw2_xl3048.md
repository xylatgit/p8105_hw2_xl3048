## Problem 1

Define the path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read in the dataset Mr.Trashwheel.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset: \* The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster
in 2017 was 8 \* The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Defind the path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data_2 = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

Read in the dataset.

``` r
subway_df =
  read.csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    sep = ",",
    na.strings=c("")
    )%>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(select = c(line:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada))%>%
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry=="YES",1,2),
    vending =  ifelse(vending=="YES",1,2)
  )
```

The original dataset on NYC Transit has 32 variables. For the homework,
we select 19 variables: line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada. The selected variables contains information about
subway stations in NYC, including their location, route served, entrance
type (stairs/easement), whethere there is vending in the station, and
whether it is ADA compliance.

The variable names of the resulted dataset is cleaned using janitor (all
lower-cased, replace space by dash). Variables of route served contains
numerous spaces, which are not recognized as NA by R when the dataset is
read. Thus, parameter na.string is purposely added to the read.csv
function. Further, character vector “entry” and “vending” are converted
to logical vector (1=YES, 2=NO).
